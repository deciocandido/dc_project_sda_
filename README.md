# Decio Candido Individual Project - SDA9

The project has been implemented on Gradle Package

#### Project Structure

There are 4 classes implemented in the project, which are taskInterface, writeFileClass, taskClass and menuClass.

The taskInterface is where we find some abstract methods declared for the task object

The taskClass is where we find the methods to set and get the task fields, such as title, project, status and due date

The menuClass is where we find the methods to add the task into an arraylist, remove task from the array

We start the project from the file mainClass.java

#### Milestone

In the Milestone you should find the tasks took to implement the ToDoList, where we also find the estimated time that should take to completed each task, **REMEMBER** estimated time. We would also find the progress made so far for each task.

The Milestone chart is divided into sessions, they are: project management, project planning, requirements analysis, design, development, QA and implementation
